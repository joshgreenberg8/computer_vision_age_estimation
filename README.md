# computer_vision_age_estimation

This repository contains an analysis and model created as part of a coursework project.

The objective of the project was to to build a deep learning network to estimate the age of a person based on an image of their face for a grocery store. The store wants to be able to use these results in their self-checkout to help screen age-verified purchases.

The data provided was a folder of images of faces with an associated file providing age labels for each image.

The notebook '[sprint_15_proj_jg_final.ipynb](https://github.com/joshgreenberg8/computer_vision_age_estimation/blob/main/sprint_15_proj_jg_final.ipynb)' contains exploratory analysis of the dataset, as well as the code establishing the neural network. Due to computational constraints, the model was trained and tested on the learning platform's GPU from the 'proj_script.py' file. 

The notebook contains the results from the training and testing of the model.
